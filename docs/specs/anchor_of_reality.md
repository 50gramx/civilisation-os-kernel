# Phase 3: The Anchor of Reality (Prediction vs. Contribution)

The user has identified the ultimate failure mode of any predictive system: If the system only rewards forecasters for predicting what other forecasters will reward, it becomes perfectly reflexive. The civilisation detaches from external reality and optimizes only for its own internal incentives. It becomes a casino.

**The Question:** Should Accountability be purely forward-looking (predictive yield only), or partially backward-looking (rewarding demonstrated contribution)?

**The Answer: Accountability requires a strict, unyielding synthesis of both.**

## 1. The Danger of Extremes

*   **Pure Forward-Looking (Prediction Only):** If the system only rewards prediction, it becomes pure Speculation. High-score actors predict the outcomes of other predictions, creating synthetic derivatives of reputation. The system loses all tether to external reality.
*   **Pure Backward-Looking (Contribution Only):** If the system only rewards past work (e.g., lines of code written, packages delivered), it becomes Labor. Without predictive valuation, all contributions are treated equally regardless of their actual long-term utility to the civilisation. It becomes an uncalibrated bureaucracy.

## 2. The Dual-Engine Mechanic

To anchor the system to reality, the physics engine requires two components to successfully interact before a single unit of Yield can be minted.

### Component A: The Proof of Impact (Backward-Looking)
Before any Vouch-Bond can be placed, an actor must submit a **Proof of Impact Payload**. This is a cryptographic declaration of a backward-looking reality:
*   *"I merged this PR into the main repository."*
*   *"I finalized this local DHT routing module."*
*   *"I successfully delivered this physical asset."*

A Proof of Impact generates exactly **zero yield** on its own. It is merely a claim of labor.

### Component B: The Vouch-Bond (Forward-Looking)
Once the Proof of Impact exists, the Senate of Forecasters can act. They lock their Accountability Score (collateral) into a Vouch-Bond attached to that specific Proof of Impact. 
*   *"I predict this specific contribution is legitimate, has high civilisational utility, and will survive adversarial scrutiny."*

## 3. Breaking the Reflexive Loop

How do we prevent forecasters from just predicting on predictions?

**The Core Rule: You cannot bond to a bond.**

*   Yield is *only* generated when a forward-looking Vouch-Bond successfully anchors to a backward-looking Proof of Impact. 
*   The system strictly prohibits recursive predicting. You cannot place a Vouch-Bond on someone else's Vouch-Bond. The cryptographic chain of prediction must always terminate at a base layer of demonstrated labor.

### The Flow of Civilisational Value
1.  **The Laborer:** Performs the external reality action and submits the Proof of Impact.
2.  **The Forecaster:** Evaluates the external reality action and locks their Accountability Score to Vouch for it.
3.  **The Resolution:** The Domain Mesh (over an epoch) verifies the lack of fraud and measures the graph-entropy of the backers.
4.  **The Reward:** 
    *   The Laborer receives **Base Yield** for bringing external reality into the system.
    *   The Forecaster receives **Predictive Yield** for accurately identifying its value early.

Prediction provides the vector (direction and weight).
Contribution provides the mass (the actual reality).

Without mass, the vector is just an arrow pointing at nothing. Without the vector, the mass is just undifferentiated noise. By strictly requiring both, the Civilisation OS anchors its predictions permanently to the physical world.
