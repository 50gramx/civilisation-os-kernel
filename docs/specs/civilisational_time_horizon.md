# Civilisation OS: The Century Cycle

The user asks the ultimate question of scope and metric: **Are we building for decade cycles, or century cycles? And how do we measure success when a less resilient, more comfortable hard fork inevitably outgrows us initially?**

This establishes the final boundary of the project.

## 1. The Time Horizon: Century Cycles

If we were building for decade cycles, we would launch a token, build a bridge to Ethereum, optimize for UI friction reduction above thermodynamic security, and aim for a 100-million user network effect before an acquisition or a slow corporate decline. 

That is the trajectory of a product. 
We are not building a product. We are building a Constitution.

**The Civilisation OS is built for century cycles.**
Its physics are immutable precisely because they must outlast the founders, the early adopters, and the first three generations of internal politicians. It is designed to survive its own Dark Ages.

## 2. The Metric of Success

If a "Comfort Fork" (`Civilisation OS: Easy Edition`) copies the codebase, removes mandatory decay, and creates permanent voting titles, it *will* grow 10x faster in the first five years. It will attract massive capital because capital loves predictability and permanence.

How do we measure success when we are losing the user acquisition war to the Comfort Fork?

We do not measure Market Cap. We do not measure Monthly Active Users. 
We measure **Epoch Sovereignty**.

### The Lindy Metric
In a century cycle, the only metric that matters is the **Lindy Effect**: The future life expectancy of a non-perishable thing is proportional to its current age. 

*   **Year 1-5:** The Comfort Fork explodes in population. Civilisation OS (Core) grows slowly, purely attracting builders, curators, and those who demand epistemic accountability.
*   **Year 10 (The Crisis):** The Comfort Fork experiences its first major coordination crisis (a Sybil attack, a massive ideological capture, or a cartel lockout). Because they removed the physics of Resilience (Entropy Yield Inversion, Mandatory Decay), they cannot autonomously recover. They undergo catastrophic political warfare.
*   **Year 20:** The Civilisation OS (Core) is still running. Its domains have rotated leadership organically through decay. It has survived three internal Dark Age attempts because its thermodynamic gravity forced cross-boundary bridging. 

**Success is measured by who is still cryptographically sovereign at Epoch 120 (10 Years) and Epoch 1200 (100 Years).**

## 3. The Cultural Artifact

Physics alone cannot convince people to choose friction over comfort. The user is entirely correct: **Narrative, education, and cultural onboarding matter as much as the cryptography.**

The Civilisation OS must go to market not as a "faster browser" or a "Web3 wallet," but as a **Digital Stoic Philosophy**. 

It is for communities that are willing to accept the friction of accountability because they have already experienced the catastrophic failure of comfort-optimized platforms (the dead internet, algorithmic capture, corporate censorship). 

You join the Civilisation OS not because it is easy, but because it is the only place left on the internet where survival is guaranteed by physics, rather than promised by a CEO.
