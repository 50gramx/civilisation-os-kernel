# Civilisation OS: The Root Layer Lifecycle & Graduated Sovereignty

This document resolves the final systemic tension in the Civilisation OS: How domains are born, and what happens to the entity that allowed them to be born.

## 1. The Graduated Sovereignty Model

The user correctly identified that a binary "Permissioned vs. Permissionless" choice is structurally fragile. The solution is **Graduated Sovereignty**.

Domains must earn their epistemic weight.

*   **Tier 0: Proto-Domains (The Ember Layer)**
    *   *Permissionless.* Anyone can spawn a Tier 0 context.
    *   *Constraint:* They are thermodynamically quarantined. Accountability Scores earned here have **zero** visibility on the "Immutable Resume" in higher tiers. They cannot mint Proof-of-Impact Yield. They are sandboxes for coordination testing.
*   **Tier 1: Recognized Domains (The Civic Layer)**
    *   *Permissioned (Criteria-Based).* A Tier 0 domain applies for Tier 1 status. The application is judged purely on structure (Does it have an atomic action? Is the milestone verifiable?), not ideology.
    *   *Power:* They gain Resume visibility and the ability to mint regulated Proof-of-Impact Yield.
*   **Tier 2: Constitutional Domains (The Senate Layer)**
    *   *Earned by Sustained Entropy.* A domain reaches Tier 2 by surviving adversarial conditions, maintaining high graph-entropy validation over years, and successfully rotating its high-weight actors (proving it didn't devolve into an oligarchy).
    *   *Power:* They gain legislative voting power over the broader Federation.

## 2. The Final Question: Does the Root Layer Dissolve?

**The Answer: The Root Layer MUST Dissolve. It is a Scaffolding, not a King.**

If the Root Layer is permanent, the Civilisation OS is just a Web2 platform with better cryptography. A permanent Root node remains a single point of failure and an inevitable target for regulatory, corporate, or ideological capture.

### The Mechanism of Dissolution (The Handover)

The system is designed as a **Bootstrapping Constitutional Republic**.

1.  **The Genesis Era:** On Day 1, a small, centralized "Root Council" (the developers/founders) must exist to approve the first few Tier 1 domains, simply because no one else is cryptographically qualified to do it. 
2.  **The Graduation Era:** Over several years, distinct domains (`food.regionX`, `climate.science`, `local.civic`) hit the cryptographic requirements to graduate to **Tier 2 (Constitutional Domains)**.
3.  **The Dissolution Trigger:** The protocol contains a hardcoded decentralization switch. Once `N` highly-uncorrelated domains (e.g., 21 domains with mathematically distinct user graphs to prevent collusive cartels) reach Tier 2, the Root Council is **cryptographically deprecated**.
4.  **The Self-Governing Mesh:** From that precise block forward, the power to approve new Tier 1 domains, and the power to adjust the base physical constants (decay rates, unbonding curves), is transferred exclusively to a decentralized voting mesh of the Tier 2 Constitutional Domains.

### Conclusion

The Civilisation OS is a temporary scaffolding toward a self-governing republic of digital city-states. 

We do not build a permanent meta-authority; we encode the conditions for its own obsolescence into the genesis block. That is the only way to build a civilisation that truly belongs to its citizens.
