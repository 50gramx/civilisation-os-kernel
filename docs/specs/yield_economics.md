# Phase 1: The Economic Temperature (Yield Mechanics)

We must define the thermodynamic supply curve of Accountability Score. Is Yield **Inflationary**, **Zero-Sum**, or **Capped**?

If we choose incorrectly:
*   **Pure Inflationary:** Decay becomes cosmetic. Early adopters hold so much score that even a 5% decay is offset by continuous ambient yield. It becomes a Fiat system.
*   **Pure Zero-Sum:** If score can only be transferred, the system becomes a zero-sum knife fight. It heavily discourages onboarding new actors because granting them score means losing your own relative power. Paranoia replaces coordination.
*   **Hard Capped:** If there is a strict maximum supply (like 21M Bitcoin), you create extreme deflationary hoarding. Accountability Score is not meant to be hoarded money; it is meant to be flowing social energy.

## The Decision: Yield is Asymptotically Equilibrium-Bound

We do not manually cap the supply. We do not make it zero-sum. 
**We rely on the physics of the Decay Function to create a natural, dynamic ceiling.**

Because every epoch applies `e^(-λ)` to the *total global supply* of Accountability Score, the system mathematically reaches an equilibrium where **Total Decay = Total Yield**.

### The Mechanic: The Targeted Impact Replenishment
1.  **Yield is Not a Percentage:** Yield is minted as absolute values tied to *Proof-of-Impact Milestones*. Say, 1000 points are minted globally this epoch for verified civic actions.
2.  **Decay is a Percentage:** Decay burns `λ` (e.g., 5%) of all existing score.
3.  **The Equilibrium Point:** If the civilisation steadily mints 1,000 points per epoch across all domains, the total global supply will naturally ceiling at exactly **20,000 points**. 
    *   *(At 20,000 supply, a 5% decay burns exactly 1,000 points. The 1,000 points of minted Yield exactly replenishes the burned score. The system is perfectly balanced.)*

### Why This is Civilisational Grade
By tying Yield to absolute impact and Decay to a percentage of total mass, the Civilisation OS creates a **Dynamic Supply Ceiling pegged to the Velocity of Reality.**

*   **If the Civilisation produces more real-world impact:** The total global yield minting rises to 2,000 points per epoch. The mathematical ceiling scales gracefully up to 40,000 total score. The economy expands.
*   **If the Civilisation stagnates:** Yield minting drops to 500 points per epoch. The decay (burning 5% of a massive 40,000 supply) aggressively grinds the money supply down until it reaches the new equilibrium at 10,000. It burns away unbacked reputation.

### Conclusion

Yield isn't inflationary, zero-sum, or hard-capped. 
**Yield is Elastic.** 

It expands precisely when the civilisation accomplishes real work, and it violently contracts when the civilisation rests on its laurels. Unearned comfort evaporates. The economic temperature perfectly matches the physical output of the Federation.
