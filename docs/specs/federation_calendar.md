# Civilisation OS: The Constitutional Calendar

This document answers the final thermodynamic tuning question for the Civilisation OS: **Are Federation votes continuous, or epoch-based?**

## 1. The Danger of Continuous Voting (The Fluid Market)

In a continuous voting system, a domain's Federation weight floats freely second-by-second based on live entropy metrics. 

While theoretically elegant, continuous voting fails on two critical fronts:

### A. The Computation Barrier (The Oracle Failure)
As identified in previous stress-tests, calculating cross-domain overlap, graph distance diversity, and internal Gini coefficients is computationally intensive. If the entire Federation must constantly agree on exact floating-point metrics for 100+ domains across a decentralized mesh, the network bandwidth collapses. You cannot run a continuous Civilisation OS locally without retreating to centralized cloud servers.

### B. The Political Volatility Penalty
If voting power shifts mid-vote, legislative predictability dies. An attacker could flood a Tier 2 domain with bots just to artificially drag its entropy score down *temporarily* during a critical Federation vote, weaponizing the continuous engine to disenfranchise their political opponents. Continuous voting replaces civic process with high-frequency trading chaos.

## 2. The Decision: Epoch-Based Voting (The Constitutional Calendar)

The Civilisation OS must run on a **Constitutional Calendar**. Voting weights and Accountability Scores are measured and locked in discrete **Epochs**.

### The Mechanics of the Epoch

**1. The Snapshot**
At the exact transition block of an Epoch (e.g., every 30 days), the mesh network finalizes the thermodynamic state of the civilisation. 
*   **Decay is Processed:** All baseline score reductions are calculated and applied simultaneously.
*   **Entropy is Measured:** The heavy graph-distance calculations, cross-validation overlap checks, and internal Gini coefficients are finalized based on the previous 30 days of unalterable history. 
*   **Yields are Distributed:** Predictive accuracy yield from Vouch-Bonds is unlocked and credited to root identities.

**2. The Locked Legislative Weight**
Once the Epoch snapshot is agreed upon by consensus, a Domain's Federation Voting Weight is **locked** for the duration of the next 30 days. No algorithmic shift, sudden user influx, or temporary Sybil attack can alter a Domain's political power during that Epoch. 

### Why Epochs Build Civilisations
*   **Security Through Asynchrony:** Epochs allow the mesh network to compute massive graph verification asynchronously, trading real-time speed for cryptographic certainty.
*   **Campaign Cycles:** Epochs create natural temporal boundaries for governance. If `climate.science` wants to increase its voting weight before an important proposal next month, they know they must spend the *current* Epoch maximizing their internal epistemic diversity to shift their snapshot measurement.
*   **Epistemic Stability:** You cannot build a multi-generational civilisation on a fluid market. The calendar provides the gravity that allows communities to plan infrastructure, trust the mechanics, and sleep at night without worrying that their civic weight will dissolve by morning.

## 3. The Immutable Core (Review)

As we seal the architectural foundations, it is confirmed that **Thermodynamic Constants are Immutable**.

The Federation can tune UI elements, grant domain access, and structure proposals. But the bedrock equations—the baseline decay constants, the unbonding cooldown window formulas, and the non-availability of tokenized liquidity bridges—are hardcoded into the genesis block. They are the physics of the environment.

The Civilisation OS isn't a fluid Web3 protocol optimizing for speculation. It is a slow, methodical, epoch-driven **Merit-Weighted Republic**.
