# Civilization OS: Cross-Domain Portability & Energy Injection

This document addresses the final thermodynamic and structural questions framing the Civilisation OS architecture.

## 1. Where Does New Energy Enter?

If Vouch-Bonds only generate Yield by redistributing existing weight, the system eventually reaches a thermodynamic heat death (zero-sum stagnation). To prevent a chilling effect, new "Accountability Fuel" must enter the system. 

### The Engine of Injection: Domain Validation
Energy cannot be minted simply by time passing, nor can it be minted arbitrarily by "founders." It must be minted by **Consensus Validation of External Reality**.

**Mechanic:** *The Proof-of-Impact Yield*
1.  A creator or civic actor submits a "Milestone Payload" to the domain (e.g., "I delivered 50 meals" or "I published the 10-part educational series").
2.  The domain's nodes (with sufficient graph distance to ensure non-collusion) Vouch-Bond the payload constraint.
3.  Upon passing a high-entropy consensus threshold, the Domain Protocol **mints new Base Accountability Score** and distributes it proportionally to:
    *   The creator/actor who achieved the milestone (the lion's share).
    *   The distant nodes who correctly verified the milestone early (the epistemic yield).

This ties energy minting directly to the fundamental purpose of the domain: *measured real-world output*. Inflation only occurs when output occurs.

## 2. Are Domains Sealed Ecosystems, or is Score Transferable?

**The Decision: Accountability is Non-Transferable (Sealed Ecosystems), but the Identity Key is Universal.**

If you allow Accountability Score to transfer 1:1 across domains, you build a *Unified Civilisation Layer*, but you instantly recreate the problems of the modern internet and venture capitalism. 

### Why Transferability Fails (The Imperialism Risk)
If a user accrues massive Accountability Score in `gaming.local` by predicting which live-streamers will become popular, and they can port that exact score into `civic.local` to dictate how neighborhood funds are spent, the system breaks. Competence in one domain does not magically equal epistemic wisdom in another. 

If scores are portable, massive whales from high-velocity entertainment domains will financially colonize slower, high-stakes civic domains.

### The Solution: Federation of Digital City-States
*   **The Root Key is Universal:** Your single device-secured keypair acts as your passport. You use the exact same cryptographic soul to enter `creators.local` and `farming.local`.
*   **The Score is Zeroed:** When you cross the border into a new domain, your Accountability Score in that new domain is **zero**. You must earn your right to speak and vouch in that specific context.
*   **The Immutable Resume:** However, Domains are aware of your history. If you enter `farming.local` with a root key that has high standing in `weather.local`, the existing citizens can *see* that you are a highly accountable actor elsewhere. This makes it infinitely easier for them to decide to grant you your initial Vouch-Bond to enter, but your *starting physics* inside their domain still begin at zero.

By keeping the ecosystems thermodynamically sealed, but keeping the passport universal, you create a true **Federation of Digital City-States**. Expertise is respected across borders, but power cannot be exported.
