# Phase 1: Transferability and Sovereignty

The final concrete pour of the Minimal Immutable Core demands an answer to the fundamental nature of the Accountability Score itself.

Is it a Currency, or is it Reputation?

**The Decision: Accountability Score is STRICTLY Non-Transferable.**

## 1. The Danger of Transferability (The Currency Trap)

If User A can simply transfer 500 Accountability Score to User B, the system ceases to be a civilisation relying on predictive epistemic value. It instantly downgrades into a standard financial economy wearing philosophical clothes.

### The Attack Vectors of Transferability:
1.  **The Secondary Market:** Capital outside the system can now buy civilizational weight inside the system. A wealthy actor can simply pay USD to 100 users to transfer their Accountability Score to a single wallet, instantly capturing Federation voting power without ever having produced a single verified Proof-of-Impact.
2.  **The Sybil Wash:** Attackers can spin up 10,000 keys, generate minor ambient yields, and funnel all the micro-yields to a central mastermind key. 
3.  **Inherited Stagnation:** Score becomes an asset that can be hoarded, traded, passed down, or locked in automated market makers. It stops reflecting the current value of the actor.

Money can be inherited. Reputation must be earned.

## 2. The Mechanics of Allocation (The Vouch-Bond)

While the base `Accountability(t)` mass cannot be transferred, it **can be allocated**.

*   **You Cannot SEND Score:** You cannot increase someone else's base score by decreasing your own. `Transfer(A, B, amount)` is not a valid mathematical function in the protocol.
*   **You Can Only LOCK Score:** You can lock a percentage of your base score into a **Vouch-Bond** targeting an entity created by User B.
    *   This lock risks your score (subject to Slashing if User B performs a protocol violation).
    *   This lock generates Predictive Yield for *you* if User B's entity later achieves high-entropy validation.
    *   It generates Proof-of-Impact Yield for *User B* based on their verified action, heavily weighted by the backing of your locked score.

### Why This Is Civilisational Grade
By making Accountability Score strictly non-transferable, but allowing it to act as cryptographic collateral to endorse the output of others, we separate **Power** from **Capital**. 

You cannot buy your way into the Federation Senate. You can only maintain your seat by continuously risking your own reputation to accurately predict and validate the high-entropy impact of others.

The Civilisation OS is not a bank. It is an epistemic mirror.
