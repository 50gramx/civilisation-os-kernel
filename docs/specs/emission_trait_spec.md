# Token Emission Economics (Step 7)

Now that the constitutional physics (the bytes, the math, the serialization order, the fraud boundaries) are fully hardened, we can finally address the tokenization. 

We must not hardcode a specific unchangeable monetary sequence into the pure transition function. Doing so would turn a constitutional protocol into a rigid token contract. Instead, the deterministic kernel defines an **Emission Trait Interface**.

## 1. The Trait Interface
To maintain isolation between physics and economics, the transition function (`apply_epoch`) accepts an explicit mathematical object implementing the `EmissionModel` trait.

```rust
pub trait EmissionModel {
    /// Called when a VouchBond is successfully verified and locked.
    /// Determines how much newly minted energy (if any) is generated by the lockup.
    fn calculate_bond_mint(
        &self, 
        staked_weight: FixedPoint, 
        lock_duration: u64
    ) -> Result<FixedPoint, ArithmeticError>;

    /// Called at the end of the epoch to compute domain-wide distributions.
    /// E.g., Distributing newly minted tokens to the active validation committee.
    fn calculate_epoch_rewards(
        &self, 
        total_active_weight: FixedPoint, 
        entropy_metric: FixedPoint
    ) -> Result<RewardDistribution, ArithmeticError>;
}
```

## 2. Model C: Bond-Based Minting
The primary recommended implementation of this trait for the Single-Domain MVP will be **Bond-Based Minting**. 

**Core Economic Constraints:**
1.  **No Arbitrary Mining:** Tokens are never minted for performing hash-power computations.
2.  **No Idle Inflation:** There is zero scheduled block reward/emission curve based merely on time passing.
3.  **Capital as the Catalyst:** Tokens are minted *exclusively* when an actor locks existing `Accountability Score` energy into a `VouchBond` to guarantee a truth claim. 
    *   The newly minted tokens are temporarily locked alongside the principal. 
    *   If the claim is proven fraudulent, *both* the principal and the unminted yield are mathematically burned.
    *   If the claim survives the `lock_duration`, the new tokens are released into the actor's liquid balance, expanding the domain's monetary supply proportionally to its authenticated truth.

## 3. The Genesis Allocation 
Because Bond-Based Minting requires *existing capital* to lock in order to mint new capital, the system requires a prime mover. 
The **Genesis Manifest** (defined in Phase 8 - Step 5 of the Dart host architecture) must hardcode the initial allocation of thermodynamic energy to the 50 Genesis Validators. This is the only time tokens are created by sovereign fiat. From Epoch 1 onward, the domain strictly follows the `EmissionModel`.
