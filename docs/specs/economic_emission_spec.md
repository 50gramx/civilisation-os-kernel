# Tokenomics: Issue and Emission (Phase 10)

Having structured a mathematically perfect and completely deterministic simulation limit via `u128`, 1e12 scale, and Dust Truncation, we can define the final component of the Civilisation OS: Tokenomics, or Token Birth Mechanics.

## 1. Bond-Based Minting Formula
We formally adopt **Bond-Based Minting**. Tokens are not arbitrary "rewards." They represent **new verifiable entropy generated by the domain**. Supply expands only when existing liquid score is deliberately locked into a VouchBond to attest to a new truth or behavior.

Tokens minted = `minting_curve(Bond_Magnitude, Lock_Duration_Epochs, Global_Entropy)`

*   **No Unbounded Minting:** An identity cannot print infinite tokens just by perpetually locking dust.
*   **The Sublinear Curve (Anti-Whale Form):** To prevent large token holders (whales) from perpetually monopolizing issuance through compounding capital, the `minting_curve` MUST be formally **sublinear**. Crucially, the sublinear damper must apply to the *product* of the Bond Magnitude and the Lock Duration.
    *   **Formula:** `minted = sqrt[(Bond_Magnitude * Lock_Duration) / SCALE] * Global_Entropy`
    *   *Rationale:* If we only applied the square root to the `Bond_Magnitude`, a whale could simply extend their `Lock_Duration` linearly to crush smaller participants. By applying the dampener to the combined economic weight, the system heavily resists oligarchic calcification, strongly pushing the domain toward decentralization over long time horizons.
*   **The Dust Spam Threshold:** To prevent attackers from spamming the network with thousands of mathematically negligible bonds (bloating the Merkle trees to exhaust validators), the protocol enforces a hard floor: `MIN_BOND_MAGNITUDE = 1 * SCALE`. Any bond proposing to lock less than one full, integer-level unit of Accountability is instantly rejected by the transition executor.

## 2. Supply Cap & Entropy Coupling
Will the domain theoretically expand infinitely if users continuously bond?

Yes, but it is **asymptotically bounded by Thermodynamic Decay**.
Every epoch, the `apply_epoch` transition applies the precomputed decay factor (`0.9439`) and intentionally destroys dust via integer truncation. 
Therefore, the tokenomics structure operates within a dynamic equilibrium:
`Net Supply Delta = Total_Newly_Minted_Score_In_Epoch - Total_Decayed_Score_In_Epoch`

Because Decay acts globally on ALL balances, while Minting acts *only* on the fraction of the system actively locked in new bonds, the domain reaches a natural total supply ceiling where global decay perfectly equals new bond generations. 

### The Entropy Multiplier (Velocity of Truth)
The variable `Global_Entropy` is NOT a simple headcount or a simple percentage of supply, as both are easily gamed by Sybil or Whale consolidation respectively. 
*   **The Baseline Equation:** `Global_Entropy = (Active_Bonded_Magnitude / Total_Supply) * (Unique_Active_Validators / Optimal_Validator_Count)`
*   **The Velocity Effect:**
    *   If only 10% of the planetary supply is bonded, the multiplier shrinks. Monopolies holding dormant `Accountability` cannot passively extract proportional yield.
    *   If a cartel attempts to consolidate validation to a single entity, the `Unique_Active_Validators` ratio plummets, devastating their own minting multiplier. 
    *   By scaling against *both* bonded magnitude and unique active validators, the global entropy scalar structurally rewards broad, active capital distribution while mechanically choking issuance if the system centralizes. This is the **Monetary Policy of the Constitution**.

## 3. Validator Execution Mathematics
Tokens are NOT arbitrarily "paid" to validators for participating in sortition computation. That is the fundamental flaw of PoW and PoS.

*   VouchBonds generate tokens to the bond-creator (acting as a measure of newly minted truth). 
*   However, a percentage (e.g., `10%` or pre-defined domain constant) of all newly minted tokens resulting from successful `VouchBonds` in a specific Epoch is diverted as a "Validation Fee".
*   This Fee pool is distributed equally among the specific Validator Committee that successfully signed that Epoch.

### The Minimum Entropy Maintenance Fee (Decay Redirection)
If an epoch experiences zero new bonds, the validator committee would theoretically earn exactly 0 new tokens if relying solely on minting. Rather than re-introducing guaranteed inflation (printing fiat money) to sustain validators during dormant periods, the system utilizes **Decay Redirection**.

**The Rule:**
A strict baseline `Y_min` is established. If the organic `VouchBond` yield in an epoch falls below `Y_min`, the difference is NOT minted. Instead, it is subtracted directly from the total "decayed dust" that was mathematically burned earlier in the epoch, and redirected to the active validator committee.
*   This ensures validators always receive a basic infrastructure offset.
*   It explicitly preserves the closed thermodynamic equilibrium curve; no new external energy enters the system arbitrarily. Inflation is strictly impossible.
