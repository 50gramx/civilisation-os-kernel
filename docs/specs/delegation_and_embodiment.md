# Phase 3: The Delegation Question (Liquid vs Embodied Power)

We previously established that Accountability Score is non-transferable (you cannot send it to another wallet like a currency). However, the user introduces a critical nuance: Can it be *delegated, lent, or pooled*? 

This is the Liquid Democracy loophole. 

If Alice cannot send her score to Bob, but she can "delegate" her voting/bonding power to Bob via a smart contract, Bob now wields the combined weight of both Alice and himself. 

**The Answer: Accountability is strictly Identity-Bound and Permanently Embodied. There is absolutely NO delegation, NO lending, and NO pooling.**

## 1. The Danger of Delegation (The Liquid Democracy Trap)

In theory, Liquid Democracy sounds efficient: "I don't have time to validate Proofs of Impact, so I will delegate my score to an expert I trust."

In adversarial reality, Delegation is simply **Transferability by Proxy**.
If delegation is permitted at the protocol layer, it creates an immediate attack vector:

1.  **Vote Buying (Dark DAOs):** Bob sets up an off-chain smart contract paying daily interest to anyone who delegates their Accountability Score to his node. He is effectively renting reputation. He pools the score of 50,000 idle users and becomes an unstoppable cartel.
2.  **The Rise of Politicians:** The system stops measuring the distributed intelligence of the mesh. It begins measuring which charismatic actors can successfully lobby the most users to delegate their power. Power aggregates like capital.
3.  **The Separation of Risk and Reward:** If Alice delegates to Bob, and Bob signs a fraudulent State Root, who is slashed? If Alice is slashed for Bob's crime, users will never delegate. If only Bob is slashed, the system loses its deterrent, because Bob is using other people's risk-free collateral.

## 2. Power Must Be Permanently Embodied

In the Civilisation OS, your cryptographic mass must remain inextricably bound to your own identity key, and it requires your own active, cognitive, computational signature to move.

**The Constraints:**
*   You cannot pool your score into a multisig.
*   You cannot delegate your VDF-Sealing lottery ticket to another node.
*   You cannot lend your score to a friend to push a Vouch-Bond over a threshold.

### The Philosophical Necessity of Friction
If you do not have the time, the context, or the conviction to evaluate a Proof of Impact yourself, **your weight should not participate.** 

If you are inactive, your score will slowly decay. This is not a bug; this is the intended thermodynamic cleansing of the system. We *want* inactive power to decay away from those who are not paying attention. 

By refusing delegation, we ensure that power can never aggregate faster than the speed of human cognition. 

*   A cartel cannot sweep up millions of delegated votes in a single day. 
*   If a cartel wants 50,000 votes, they must physically persuade 50,000 individual, active, risk-bearing human minds to independently run the math, sign the bond, and lock their own collateral. 

Power remains permanently embodied in the individual. It cannot be securitized, it cannot be loaned, and it cannot be automated away to a proxy. You either bear the risk of sovereignty yourself, or you surrender it to entropy.
