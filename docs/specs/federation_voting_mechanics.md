# Civilisation OS: Federation Voting Mechanics

This document resolves the final constitutional fork for the post-Root Civilisation OS:
When the Root Governance Layer dissolves, how do the Tier 2 domains vote? Is it a Confederation of Equals (1 Domain = 1 Vote) or a Merit-Weighted Republic?

---

## 1. The Danger of the Confederation of Equals (1 Domain = 1 Vote)

If every Tier 2 domain gets exactly one equal vote, the system optimizes for extreme **stability**, but it becomes vulnerable to the **Sybil Domain Attack**.

If `climate.science` (with 500,000 highly active users and millions of verified Proof-of-Impact Yields) has the exact same voting weight as `niche-hobby.local` (which technically survived enough entropy to reach Tier 2 but only has 10,000 users), attackers will optimize for creating the minimum viable Tier 2 domains rather than creating massive real-world impact. 

A Confederation of Equals incentivizes the splintering of domains just to capture federation-level voting seats. It leads to political stagnation where massive civic engines are outvoted by a coalition of tiny, technically compliant outliers.

## 2. The Decision: A Merit-Weighted Republic (Entropy-Bounded)

The Civilisation OS must be a **Merit-Weighted Republic**. The system must optimize for **performance** (real-world impact and high-fidelity epistemic coordination).

However, if voting weight is tied strictly to *population* or *raw impact output*, massive domains become imperial dictators over the federation. 

### The Metric: Entropy-Weighted Voting Power
A Tier 2 Domain's voting power at the Federation level is not calculated by its total number of users or its total minted score. It is calculated by its **Sustained Entropy Mass**.

**Voting Weight Formula Factors:**
1.  **Graph Entropy:** How decentralized is the trust graph within that domain? If 90% of the Vouch-Bonds originate from an elite 1% of users, the domain's external voting weight is severely discounted, regardless of its size.
2.  **Cross-Domain Validation:** How often do highly-accountable users from *other* sealed domains validate the output of this domain? (Remember, scores don't transfer, but immutable resumes are visible).
3.  **Longevity Scaling (Logarithmic):** The time a domain has spent in Tier 2 without an entropy collapse increases its weight, but logarithmically. A 10-year-old domain has more weight than a 1-year-old domain, but a 100-year-old domain cannot mathematically outvote ten 10-year-old domains.

### Why Entropy Bounding Works
By linking Federation voting weight directly to internal Graph Entropy and Logarithmic Longevity, the Civilisation OS aligns the incentives perfectly:

*   To gain power over the global Federation, a domain **cannot** just import millions of bots.
*   To gain power, a domain **must** continuously maximize its own internal decentralization and epistemic diversity. 
*   If a massive Tier 2 domain allows an internal oligarchy to capture its curation engine, its internal entropy calculation collapses. Even though it remains a large domain, its Federation-level voting weight plummets autonomously, stripping the oligarchy of global power.

## 3. The Immutable Constants (The Bedrock)

As noted, even a Merit-Weighted Republic can vote itself into corruption if the rules of physics are mutable. The final step before Root Dissolution is embedding the **Immutables**. 

The Federation *can* vote (weighted by Entropy) to admit new Tier 1 domains, adjust UI standards, or tune the exact Yield decimals. 

**The Federation CANNOT vote to change:**
1.  **The Pure Native Requirement:** The system cannot be bridged to external L1 chains for fiat liquidity via protocol-level actions.
2.  **The Sealing of Domains:** Accountability Score remain non-transferable 1:1.
3.  **The Identity Anchor:** The necessity of the local keypair and the atomic Vouch-Bond mechanism.
4.  **The Root Irreversibility:** Once Root dissolves, no voting threshold can legally reinstate a supreme council.

We are building a Merit-Weighted Republic where power is strictly derived from the mathematical proof of internal democratic health, resting on an immutable physical foundation.
