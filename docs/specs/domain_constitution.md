# Civilisation OS: The Constitution of Domains

This document answers the defining meta-political question of the Civilisation OS: **Who defines what a "Domain" is?**

## 1. The Danger of Permissionless Creation (The Web3 Trap)

If any user can click a button and spawn `my-new-rules.local`, the system instantly degrades into an **Emergent Ecosystem** (like Ethereum smart contracts or Discord servers). 

### The Fatal Flaws of a Permissionless Meta-Layer:
1.  **Infinite Fragmentation:** If your Accountability Score matters in `civic.local`, but anyone can fork the domain into `civic-rebel.local` the moment they face a political setback, the thermodynamic weight of the original domain is destroyed. Accountability only works when exit has a cost.
2.  **Epistemic Inflation:** If domains can be spammed, the value of cross-domain Reputation Attestation drops to zero. A user could spawn 100 ghost domains, artificially pump their Accountability Score internally, and use that fake "Resume" to gain easier entry into legitimate domains.
3.  **The Sybil Meta-Attack:** Permissionless creation shifts the Sybil attack from faking *users* to faking *entire societies*.

## 2. The Structured Federation (The Constitutional Model)

The Civilisation OS must be a **Structured Federation**. Domain creation cannot be open to the public on Day 1. It must be a highly rigorous, constitutional process.

### The Mechanics of Domain Genesis
A new domain does not come into existence because someone registered a name. It comes into existence because it solves a coordination failure that requires an epistemic boundary. 

New domains should be proposed to a **Root Governance Node** (or a consortium of existing, mature domain delegates). 

**Domain Genesis Requirements:**
*   **A Defined Core Atomic Action:** What is the specific real-world impact this domain measures? (e.g., `food.local` measures physical delivery; `weather.local` measures predictive accuracy).
*   **The Yield Threshold:** The new domain must prove it has a sufficient initial network of participants (a genesis quorum) willing to risk their root identity reputation to bootstrap the domain.

## 3. The End State: An Epistemic Federation

We are not building a platform where people host their personal hobbies. We are building digital city-states with cryptographically enforced natural laws.

By forcing Domain Genesis to be a slow, permissioned, consensus-driven process (even if Identity Onboarding *within* the domain is dynamic and decentralized), we ensure that when a user sees `Domain: medicine.local` inside the browser, they know that domain has thermodynamic mass, structural integrity, and real-world stakes. 

The Civilisation OS is not an app store. It is a **Constitution for Epistemic Truth**.
