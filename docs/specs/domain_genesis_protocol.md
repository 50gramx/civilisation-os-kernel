# Phase 4: The Domain Genesis Protocol

We must determine the rules for creating a new thermodynamic partition (a Domain).
Is creation permissionless (anyone can click a button and spawn a new domain DHT)? Or is it curated (gatekept)?

If permissionless: The system is flooded with millions of dead, zero-entropy domains. The namespace becomes chaotic. 
If curated: We risk centralized gatekeeping at genesis.

**The Answer: Domain Creation is Permissioned by the Root Layer, and requires a Genesis Cohort.**

## 1. The Necessity of the Genesis Cohort

Because we chose **Modular Identity** (every user starts at 0 Accountability in a new domain), a brand new domain has a fatal physics problem: 
*   No one has Accountancy Score.
*   Therefore, no one can sign a Vouch-Bond.
*   Therefore, no yield can be minted.
*   The system is perfectly frozen at absolute zero.

To ignite the domain engine, we cannot allow individuals to spin up domains alone. A domain must be ignited by a **Genesis Cohort**.

### The Ignition Mechanic
1.  **The Petition:** A group of users (e.g., minimum 50 unique Root-Layer identities) must form an off-chain consensus to start a new domain (e.g., `climate-science.federation`).
2.  **The Genesis Stake:** These founding members must prove their commitment by locking a fraction of their *Root Layer Accountability Score* as a one-time Genesis Stake. (This is the only time cross-domain weight is ever recognized, and it is strictly for ignition, not ongoing governance).
3.  **The Ignition:** If the Root Layer (The Federation Senate) votes to approve the new domain petition based on the Genesis Stake, the new domain DHT is spawned.
4.  **The Starting State (Epoch 0):** The 50 founding members are granted a flat, equal **Genesis Base Score** in the new domain. 

From Epoch 1 onward, the domain is sealed. No more Root Layer input is accepted. The founders must immediately begin doing real labor (Proofs of Impact) and bonding to each other to generate yield, or their flat Genesis Score will succumb to standard decay.

## 2. Preventing Dead Domains (The Thermodynamic Purge)

Why must the Root Layer vote to allow it? Because we must protect human attention bandwidth.

We want intelligence density, not fragmentation. If a domain fails to achieve liftoff—if the Genesis Cohort does not produce valuable Proofs of Impact, or if they fail to attract new modular identities to join and validate—their Accountability Scores will decay to zero.

**The Purge Rule:**
If the aggregate Accountability Score of an entire domain falls below a critical thermodynamic floor (e.g., 90% of the domain reaches absolute zero), the domain is mathematically declared **Dead**. 
*   The DHT stops accepting new VDF proofs.
*   The domain's namespace is released.
*   The domain is archived.

### The Engineering Conclusion
We do not optimize for speed, mass democracy, or permissionless spam. We optimize for high-trust, low-velocity, epistemically dense civilisational soil. 

You cannot spawn a domain on a whim. You must convince a cohort of peers to risk their Root protocol reputation to ignite the spark, and then you must relentlessly perform real labor to keep the fire alive against the wind of decay.
