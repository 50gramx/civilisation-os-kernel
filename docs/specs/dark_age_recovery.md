# Civilisation OS: The Dark Age Recovery Protocol

We have removed the Root, frozen the physics, and decentralized governance. What happens when the entire system simultaneously degrades into ideological capture, cultural polarization, or systemic echo chambers? 

This is the ultimate test of resilience. If all Tier 2 domains suffer an entropy collapse simultaneously, the Federation cannot correct itself via voting because the voters *are* the corrupted cartels.

The recovery mechanism cannot rely on humans. It must rely on thermodynamics.

## 1. The Trigger: Identifying the Dark Age

The system continuously measures Global Federation Entropy at each constitutional epoch. 

**The Dark Age Threshold** is defined mathematically across the mesh:
*   *Cross-Domain Overlap* approaches zero (domains stop acknowledging each other's existence or output).
*   *Internal Gini Coefficients* across 80%+ of Tier 2 domains exceed high limits (internal oligarchies have formed).
*   *Cross-Bonding Graph Distance* collapses (people only Vouch-Bond within their exact political/cultural sub-graphs).

When the global aggregate of these metrics falls below the **Constitutional Survival Line**, the system does not call for an emergency vote.

Instead, the **Dark Age Protocol** autonomously engages.

## 2. The Engine of Recovery: Entropy Yield Inversion

In normal operation, the Proof-of-Impact Yield rewards *Predictive Consensus* (backing an entity early that later becomes widely accepted). But during a Dark Age, "consensus" is just mob rule by the local cartel. 

When the Dark Age Protocol engages, it triggers the **Entropy Yield Inversion**.

### The Mechanism
The yield formula flips its primary multiplier. It stops heavily rewarding consensus within a domain, and begins astronomically rewarding **Cross-Boundary Bridging.**

1.  If a user in a highly isolated, polarized domain (e.g., `ideology-a.local`) spends their scarce Accountability Score to Vouch-Bond a validated impact payload in a hostile or completely disconnected domain (`ideology-b.local`), the system flags this as high-entropy bridging.
2.  If that cross-domain bond survives the epoch without slashing, the Yield multiplier attached to that specific bond is magnified to extreme levels (e.g., 50x to 100x baseline).
3.  Simultaneously, the Yield multiplier for bonding entities within your *own* immediate cluster drops to near zero, regardless of how much "consensus" those entities achieve.

### Why This Physics Engine Works
If you want to earn Accountability Score and regain power during a Dark Age, you are economically forced to act as a diplomat.

The thermodynamic gravity of the system pulls users *out* of their echo chambers. Cartel leaders, desperate to maintain their weight against decay, are mathematically compelled to seek out and validate objective truth in distant, disconnected graph nodes. 

You do not need to persuade people to be open-minded. You simply structure the physics of the universe so that open-mindedness is the only profitable action available.

## 3. The Re-Awakening

This is a self-healing bias encoded into the Genesis Block.

As thousands of users and validators start bridging across the polarized clusters to capture the inverted yield, the global graph physically re-knits itself. 

1.  Cross-domain validation metrics rise.
2.  Clustering coefficients drop.
3.  Global Federation Entropy slowly re-crosses the Constitutional Survival Line.

Once stabilization is achieved and mathematically verified across multiple successive epochs, the Dark Age Protocol disengages autonomously. Standard Yield physics resume.

The civilisation survives its dark age, not because a Root council stepped in to save it, but because its immutable physics dictated that extreme isolation eventually carries an unbearable thermodynamic cost.
