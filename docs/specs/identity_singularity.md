# Phase 3: The Identity Singularity (Unified vs. Modular Selfhood)

The user poses the absolute final sociological design parameter: Is identity itself permanent and singular across the entire Civilisation OS, or can a human hold multiple domain-specific identities with independent Accountability scores?

If we choose Unified Personhood, a user has one global key and one global Accountability Score that travels with them into every domain.
If we choose Modular Selfhood, a user generates a distinct identity (and separate score ledger) for every domain they interact with.

**The Answer: Modular Selfhood (Contextual Identity). Identity is not singular.**

## 1. The Danger of the Global "God-King" (Unified Personhood)

If Accountability Score is global, we create catastrophic systemic risks:

1.  **The Monopoly of Expertise:** If Alice accumulates massive Accountability over 10 years by accurately predicting outcomes in `software.engineering`, and she decides to enter the `biotech.research` domain, she arrives instantly as a max-weight validator. This is intellectually absurd. Epistemic accuracy in software does not translate to epistemic accuracy in biology. A unified identity allows power to cross boundaries where it has no empirical right to exist.
2.  **Systemic Contagion:** If a user makes a catastrophic, malicious error in a niche hobby domain and suffers a nuclear slashing event, a unified identity means their reputation is burned down across their professional, scientific, and cultural domains simultaneously. The blast radius of a single failure is uncontained.
3.  **The Cult of Personality:** Unified identity leads to the optimization of the *Person* rather than the *Decision*. Power centralizes around globally famous identities, drowning out quiet, domain-specific experts.

## 2. The Physics of Contextual Identity (Modular Selfhood)

In the Civilisation OS, each Domain is an isolated thermodynamic partition (a separate DHT mesh). Therefore, Identity must be partitioned to match the physics.

*   When a user joins `quantum-physics.p2p`, their browser generates a new, unique Ed25519 keypair specific to that mesh. 
*   They start with 0 Accountability Score. 
*   They must earn their epistemic weight from scratch within that specific context by anchoring to the dual-engine (Labor + Prediction) of *that specific domain*.

### The Antifragile Benefits
1.  **Strict Meritocracy:** Power is strictly contextual. The most powerful actor in computing is a zero-weight observer in theology, until they prove themselves otherwise.
2.  **Blast Radius Containment:** If a user's identity is slashed to zero in one domain, their identities in all other domains remain completely unaffected. Failures are hermetically sealed.
3.  **Sybil Resistance:** Because you start at zero in every domain, spinning up 10,000 modular identities costs nothing but gives you exactly 0 voting weight. To gain power, a Sybil identity must perform massive cumulative labor or accurate prediction—at which point, they are functionally indistinguishable from an honest, valuable contributor.
4.  **Privacy by Design:** Users naturally segment their lives without relying on "zero-knowledge proofs" for anonymity. Your political forecasting identity does not need to be cryptographically linked to your open-source coding identity.

## 3. The Voluntary Portfolio (The Social Bridge)

If all identities are modular, how does someone build a career or a unified reputation if they *want* to?

The system allows a user to voluntarily sign a cross-domain claim: *"The key controlling identity A in Domain X is also the key controlling identity B in Domain Y."* 
This creates a **Voluntary Portfolio of Selves**. But critically, the *protocol* ignores this link. The physics engine treats them as two separate entities. The link only exists in the Unmeasured Zone (The Agora) for human social context. 

We do not optimize for the unified self. We optimize for the contextual accuracy of the fragmented mind.
