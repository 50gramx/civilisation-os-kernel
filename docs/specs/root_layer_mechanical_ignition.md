# Phase 4: The Root Layer Role and Mechanical Ignition

The user has correctly identified a fatal flaw in the previous Domain Genesis conceptualization. 

If the Root Layer (The Federation Senate) must *vote* to approve a new domain, we have introduced discretionary meta-governance. We have accidentally built a choke point where high-score Root actors can gatekeep domain creation, leading to institutional conservatism, suppression of fringe domains, and ultimate centralization at the meta-layer.

**The Correction: The Root Layer is NOT a permanent political Senate. It is an automated, mechanistic ignition scaffold.**

## 1. Stake-Weighted Mechanical Ignition (No Voting)

We must remove human discretion from domain creation, while maintaining anti-spam friction and cohort requirements to solve the zero-entropy bootstrapping problem.

**The New Genesis Mechanic:**
A new domain (DHT mesh) spawns automatically and deterministically when a mathematical threshold is met. There is no vote. There is no approval committee.

1.  **The Cohort Requirement:** A minimum of 50 unique Root-Layer identities must cryptographically sign a Domain Genesis manifest.
2.  **The Genesis Stake:** Each founding identity must lock a portion of their Root Layer Accountability Score.
3.  **The Algorithmic Ignition:** The aggregate locked stake must exceed the `Global Ignition Threshold`.
4.  **The Spawn Event:** The millisecond the threshold is mathematically breached, the Root Layer protocol automatically registers the new namespace and emits the Domain Genesis Block. 
5.  **The Lockup:** The Genesis Stake is locked at the Root Layer for a minimum of *X epochs*. If the new domain dies (falls below the thermodynamic activity floor) before the lockup expires, the stake is burned. If the domain survives, the stake is returned safely to the founders' Root identities.

## 2. The Dynamic Ignition Threshold

To prevent spam while avoiding political gatekeeping, the `Global Ignition Threshold` cannot be a static number. It must be dynamically algorithmic, similar to Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment.

The Threshold automatically adjusts based on:
*   **Total Active Domains:** If there are too many domains starving for attention, the threshold rises, requiring more initial mass to spark a new one.
*   **Total System Entropy:** If the federation as a whole is highly active and diverse, the threshold lowers, encouraging more namespace exploration.

## 3. Demoting the Root Layer

By mechanizing Domain Genesis, we permanently strip the Root Layer of discretionary political power. 

The Root Layer is not a governing body. **It is merely a generic namespace registry and a stake-locking smart contract.** It does not opine on the validity, morality, or necessity of a new domain. It only measures whether sufficient cryptographic mass has been staked by a sufficiently diverse cohort to justify the bandwidth of a new DHT partition.

We preserve friction. We eliminate politics. The civilisation remains decentralized at every stratum.
